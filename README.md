# Charging Monitor

Most smartphones have Lithium ion batteries which have greater battery life and endurance. When charging these
batteries it should not surpass 80%. If the battery is charged fully at 100% the battery life will degrade overtime.
Thus when charging your battery don't let it pass 80%.

This app helps you do just that. It notifies you when your battery gets at 80% capacity so that you will remove the
charging cord and keep your battery healthy for longer time.
