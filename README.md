# Charging Monitor

We all have the frustration associated with battery life of smart phones. The batteries degrade overtime and does
not last a day without recharging. What can I do get better battery life?

One thing you can do it change your battery charging habit. Charge your phone betwen 30% and 80% range.

This app helps by reminding you to unplug your smartphone when it reaches 80% battery level.

## Lithium Ion Battery Charging and Discharging

During discharge, lithium ions (Li+) carry the current within the battery from the negative to the positive electrode, 
through the non-aqueous electrolyte and separator diaphragm.

During charging, an external electrical power source (the charging circuit) applies an over-voltage (a higher voltage 
than the battery produces, of the same polarity), forcing a charging current to flow within the battery from the positive 
to the negative electrode, i.e. in the reverse direction of a discharge current under normal conditions. The lithium 
ions then migrate from the positive to the negative electrode, where they become embedded in the porous electrode material 
in a process known as intercalation.

Energy losses arising from electrical contact resistance at interfaces between electrode layers and at contacts with 
current-collectors can be as high as 20% of the entire energy flow of batteries under typical operating conditions.

### Procedure

The charging procedures for single Li-ion cells, and complete Li-ion batteries, are slightly different.

A single Li-ion cell is charged in two stages:

* Constant current (CC).
* Constant voltage (CV).

A Li-ion battery (a set of Li-ion cells in series) is charged in three stages:

* Constant current.
* Balance (not required once a battery is balanced).
* Constant voltage.

During the constant current phase, the charger applies a constant current to the battery at a steadily increasing voltage, 
until the voltage limit per cell is reached.

During the balance phase, the charger reduces the charging current (or cycles the charging on and off to reduce the average 
current) while the state of charge of individual cells is brought to the same level by a balancing circuit, until the battery 
is balanced. Some fast chargers skip this stage. Some chargers accomplish the balance by charging each cell independently.

During the constant voltage phase, the charger applies a voltage equal to the maximum cell voltage times the number of
cells in series to the battery, as the current gradually declines towards 0, until the current is below a set threshold 
of about 3% of initial constant charge current.

Periodic topping charge about once per 500 hours. Top charging is recommended to be initiated when voltage goes below 4.05 V/cell.

Failure to follow current and voltage limitations can result in an explosion.
